volatile is a simple notification icon which controls audio volume via ALSA,
and was designed for the Xfce panel.

Clicking the icon brings up a volume slider. Context-clicking the icon
toggles mute.  Scrolling while hovering the icon (whether the slider is visible
or not) also adjusts the volume.

volatile repeatedly polls the ALSA mixer in order to relect changes to its
status made from outside the program.

This program is meant to be simple and so doesn't do a lot of error checking.
It may not be particularly robust.

pyalsaaudio is required in order to use volatile:
